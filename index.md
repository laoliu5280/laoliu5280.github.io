<p>I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, working at the <a href="https://chicagohai.github.io/" target="_blank">Chicago Human + AI Lab (CHAI)</a> and advised by Professor <a href="https://chenhaot.com/" target="_blank">Chenhao Tan</a>. My research focuses on natural language processing (NLP), explainable AI, and hypothesis generation, with the goal of creating interpretable AI systems that support scientific discovery and deepen our understanding of the physical world.</p>
<p>Outside of research, I enjoy playing the piano, tennis, and experimenting in the kitchen.</p>
